            <p>Blender is being developed by hundreds of contributors from around the world, including studios and
                individual artists, professionals and hobbyists, scientists and students, VFX experts and animators, and
                many more. All united by the desire to have access to a fully free and open-source 3D creation pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>The **Blender Foundation** supports and facilitates these goals. Thanks to donations, the **Blender
                Institute** and **Blender Studio** projects enable a small group of people to work full-time on Blender.
            </p>
            <p>For everything else, we depend on volunteers from the online community to achieve this goal. More help is
                always welcome!</p>
